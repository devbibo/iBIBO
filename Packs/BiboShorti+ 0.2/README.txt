Hello it is me BiboArtist... Before starting make sure that you downloaded the resource pack you wanted , cuz there are two versions "BiboShorti" and "BiboShorti+" , this is the The "+" one "BiboShorti+" , It contains a nice sky overlay and you can find 4 overlays at least if you downloaded this version (0.2) , so if you wanted to use one of the overlays I will teach you how :

1 - After extracting the zip file you will open the folder , and you will see three files in the folder , first one is the "BiboShorti+ 0.2" the second is "Sky Overlays (Shorti+ 0.2)" the third is "README.txt" and it is the file that you are reading right now..

2 - If you wanted to use the pack without using any overlay so you will copy or cut the first folder which is "BiboShorti + 0.2" and add it to the game and if you don't know how so you can search in the internet or "Youtube" and you can get many videos and sites , and now you don't need the sky overlays folder you can delete it or keep it if you want to use it later..

3 - But!! If you wanted to use one of the overlays (They are only 4 lol) , you will need to open the "Sky Overlays (Shorti+ 0.2)" folder and use one of the 4 overlays and the third one or the "3" folder is the overlay that already in the pack so if you loved it you don't need to copy it or something like that but if you loved the "1" or "2" or "4" so you will open "environment" folder you found in the "textures" folder you found in the overlay you loved (1 , 2 , and 4) , then copy everything in the "overworld_cubemap" folder you found in the "environment" and paste it to the "BiboShorti+ 0.2/textures/environment/overworld_cubemap" and it will give you a message like "Replace the files in the destination" and click it , and you are done with this , the sky will change and you can use the pack , and also you don't need to copy the "Sky Overlays (Shorti+ 0.2)" folder with the pack keep it in any destination and done!


Anyway hope you like the resource pack don't forget to visit the iBIBO site to make sure if there is a new version of this pack!
